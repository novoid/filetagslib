This is a utility library for providing functions related to the
[[https://github.com/novoidfiletags/filetags][filetags method]] which is also described [[https://karl-voit.at/managing-digital-photographs/][on this blog entry]].

If you do support its file name convention, you might find here some
valuable tools:
